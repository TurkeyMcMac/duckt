(^)= -{DUCKT}

This is a program similar to some others which I have written, except that is
more polished and customizeable. Namely, this one supports UTF-8 and allows for
custom ducks.

(^)= -{CUSTOM DUCKS}

These can be provided using the -o and -c options to specify two frames: the
(o)pen-mouthed frame and the (c)lose-mouthed frame. Each frame template must
contain "TEXT" somewhere, specifying where speech should go.

An example of custom frames, using a smiley face speaker rather than a duck:

$ duckt -o '😃 ~(TEXT)' -c '😐 ~(TEXT)' 'Hello, world!'
(the animation plays)
😃 ~(Hello, world!)

(^)= -{MORE INFORMATION}

More information can be found by using the -h option.
