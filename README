(^)= -{DUCKT}

This is a program similar to some others which I have written, except that is
more polished and customizeable. Namely, this one supports UTF-8 and allows for
custom ducks.

(^)= -{CUSTOM DUCKS}

These can be provided using the -o and -c options to specify two frames: the
(o)pen-mouthed frame and the (c)lose-mouthed frame. Each frame template must
contain "TEXT" somewhere, specifying where speech should go.

An example of custom frames, using a smiley face speaker rather than a duck:

$ duckt -o 'üòÉ ~(TEXT)' -c 'üòê ~(TEXT)' 'Hello, world!'
(the animation plays)
üòÉ ~(Hello, world!)

(^)= -{KNOWN BUGS}

 * When a message must wrap and the terminal window moves down to accomodate,
   each frames begins being printed on its own line.
 * On the Mac OS terminal, the ANSI escape codes for setting and restoring
   position do nothing (a carriage return must be used,) so the program will do
   the same thing as documented above even without reaching the bottom of the
   window.

(^)= -{MORE INFORMATION}

More information can be found by using the -h option.
